# omp-mpi-basics
Small examples coded in Fortran demonstrating the basic usage of the OpenMP and MPI APIs for parallelization. Coded during the course "Parallel Programming of High Performance Systems 2022" by  Erlangen National High Performance Computing Center (NHR@FAU) and Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ). Code can be compiled e.g. with `mpiifort`, for invoking OpenMP the flag `-qopenmp` needs to be set.
